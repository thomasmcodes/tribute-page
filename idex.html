        <p class="biography-text">Troy Aumua Polamalu, born April 19, 1981, is a former American football
            strong safety who played his entire 12-year career for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football
            League
            (NFL). He played college football for the University of Southern California (USC) and earned consensus
            All-American honors. He was chosen by the Steelers in the first round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He was a member
            of
            two Steelers' Super Bowl championship teams and was the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2010. Polamalu
            is an
            eight-time Pro Bowler and a six-time All-Pro selection. He was also the Head of Player Relations of the
            Alliance
            of American Football. Considered a "premier safety of his era" and known for his "range, explosiveness, and
            impact on the field," Polamalu was inducted into the Pro Football Hall Of Fame in 2020, his first year of
            eligibility. </p>
